NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NextVersion::Semantic - update the next version,
    semantic-wise

VERSION
    version 0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
        # in dist.ini

        [NextVersion::Semantic]
        major = MAJOR, API CHANGE
        minor = MINOR, ENHANCEMENTS
        revision = REVISION, BUG FIXES

        ; must also load a PreviousVersionProvider
        [PreviousVersion::Changelog]

DESCRIPTION
    Increases the distribution's version according to the semantic
    versioning rules (see <http://semver.org/>) by inspecting the changelog.

    More specifically, the plugin performs the following actions:

    at build time
        Reads the changelog using "CPAN::Changes" and filters out of the
        "{{$NEXT}}" release section any group without item.

    before a release
        Ensures that there is at least one recorded change in the changelog,
        and increments the version number in consequence. If there are
        changes given outside of the sections, they are considered to be
        minor.

    after a release
        Updates the new "{{$NEXT}}" section of the changelog with
        placeholders for all the change categories. With categories as given
        in the *SYNOPSIS*, this would look like

            {{$NEXT}}

              [MAJOR]

              [API CHANGE]

              [MINOR]

              [ENHANCEMENTS]

              [REVISION]

              [BUG FIXES]

    If a version is given via the environment variable "V", it will taken
    as-if as the next version.

    For this plugin to work, your Dist::Zilla configuration must also
    contain a plugin consuming the
    Dist::Zilla::Role::YANICK::PreviousVersionProvider role.
